A deck of cards can provide a varying workout which is simple to use and is different most times.  Each suit is assigned an exercise.  The face value of the card is the number of repetitions of the exercise, with face cards valued at ten.  The joker can be optional.

### Example

* hearts: pushups
* diamonds: squats
* spaces: situps
* clubs: jumping jacks, 4 count

1. Draw a card
1. Match the exercise to the suit
1. Do that exercise as many times as the value of the card, face cards are ten
1. Repeat until the deck is done

This can take as little as ten minutes, maybe less depending on the exercises and pace.  It can take much longer, again depending on exercises and pace.  Before starting give the deck a good shuffle.  By shuffling the sequence will be different, sometimes more favorable and sometimes having very difficult sequences, like having all the face cards of a suit in sequence.

### Modifications

To increase the challenge more difficult exercises can be used.  Or use alternative exercises for values five and less.  Also including the joker cards as a special exercise.
