<p><a href="https://skhquest.com" title="Toshindo SKHQuest">Toshindo</a> is the martial art lead by Anshu Mr. and Mrs. Hayes.</p>
<p>It is a self defense art with a philosophy of protection and reaching your own potential.</p>
<p>Our local group trains once a week at the farm and uses zoom as a back up to in person training.  Zoom has been helpful not only during the pandemic but also when the weather prohibitted travel or when guests were visiting, to save travel time, or when someone is sick and avoiding spreading their virus to others.</p>
