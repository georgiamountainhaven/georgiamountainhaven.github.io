          <h1>Every minute on the minute</h1>
              <p>Also abbreviated EMOM<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.  Do a series of exercises every minute.  The faster the exercises are completed that minute the more recovery time waiting for the next minute to start.  The exercises and repetition count for each exercise are all adjustable.  One goal is to get thirty to forty five seconds of exercise with fifteen seconds of break.  This pattern can be repeated for five minutes, ten minutes, twenty minutes, or whatever time you have available.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>This is a common set for EMOM.  Do ten of the following exercises:</p>
<ul>
<li>squats</li>
<li>push-ups</li>
<li>sit-ups</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="modifications">Modifications</h2>
<p>If you are just starting out or have other limitations, ten repetitions of each exercise may be too much.  Start with a smaller number, maybe five.</p>
<p>One way to make this more challenging is to stat increasing the count.  For the last five minutes try adding one to the count each minute and for the last minute try to double the starting count.</p>
